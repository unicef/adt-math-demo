        "sectioneli5-0-0": "Simplifying an expression means making it as simple as possible. For '3x + 4x', you add the numbers in front of the 'x'. So it's like having 3 apples and getting 4 more apples; you end up with 7 apples. So, 3x + 4x becomes 7x. You're making it shorter and easier to understand.",
        "sectioneli5-0-1": "When you see 'a + a + a + a + a + a', it's like having 6 of the same thing, 'a'. Instead of writing 'a' many times, you can just write '6a'. It's like saying you have 6 apples instead of saying 'apple' six times.",
        "sectioneli5-0-2": "We have to simplify '5(2x)'. This means we want to make it as simple as we can. Think of it like having 5 bags, and each bag has 2 candies (x). So, all together, you have 5 times 2 candies, which is 10 candies. So, '5(2x)' simplifies to '10x'. This makes it easier to understand and use.",
        "sectioneli5-0-3": "In this activity, we're taking a math expression '5 + 2x' and checking if we can make it shorter or simpler. Because 5 is just a number and 2x is a number with a letter (like a mystery number), we can't put them together. So, '5 + 2x' is already as easy as it gets. We call this 'already simplified'.",
        "sectioneli5-0-4": "To simplify 5(2x) + 10, first imagine you have 5 groups of 2 cookies. That's like saying you have 10 cookies in total because 5 times 2 is 10. So you turn 5(2x) into 10x. Now you have 10x + 10. And that's as simple as it gets, just like counting all your cookies together.",
        "sectioneli5-0-5": "To make math problems simpler, we can combine things that are alike. In the expression 'f + 7 + 3f + 5', we want to put the parts with 'f' together. So we take 'f' and '3f' (which means 3 times 'f') and combine them to get '4f'. Then we add the plain numbers 7 and 5 together to get 12. So, the simpler version of this problem is '4f + 12'.",
        "sectioneli5-0-6": "When we see 5(9x) + 5(7), it means we need to do some multiplying. First, multiply 5 by 9x, which gives you 45x, and then multiply 5 by 7, which is 35. After that, you just add these two results together, so it's 45x + 35.",
        "sectioneli5-0-7": "Let's look at this expression: 3(7x) - 10x. It's like having three groups of 7 apples and then taking away 10 apples. First, let's find out how many apples we have in the groups: 3 times 7 makes 21 apples. Now, take away 10 apples, so you have 11 apples left. So, the answer is 11x!",
        "sectioneli5-0-8": "Imagine you have 3 apples and then you get 6 groups of 4 apples each. First, you figure out how many apples are in those 6 groups. 6 times 4 apples is 24 apples! Now, you add that to your first 3 apples to see how many you have altogether. So, 3 apples plus 24 apples gives you 27 apples. In math terms, we just simplified the expression from '3x + 6(4x)' to '27x'!",
        "sectioneli5-0-9": "To simplify '8(x + x + x)', think of it like adding three stacks of blocks. Each 'x' is a stack, so we have 'x + x + x' which makes '3x'. Now, we multiply '3x' by 8, like having 8 groups of 3 stacks. So, the simplified expression becomes '24x'.",
        "sectioneli5-0-10": "When you see 5(2d + d + d), think of it as a little math puzzle. Inside the brackets, you have 2d plus three more d's. So you have 5d in total there. Now, you use the 5 outside to multiply with that 5d, which means 5 times 5d gives you 25d. So, the simplified answer is 25d.",
        "sectioneli5-0-11": "Let's make this math problem easier! We have this expression: 6n + 10 + 5n - 7. Think of 'n' as a group of things. So if you have 6 of those groups and then add 5 more, you get 11 groups of 'n'. Now, look at the numbers: 10 and -7. If you have 10 and take away 7, you have 3 left. So, when you make it simpler, it's 11n + 3.",
        "sectioneli5-0-12": "Simplifying an expression is like putting all the same types of toys together. If you have a car, a doll, and a ball, you can't put them together, just like in 'a + b + c + 100.' Since the letters (toys) are all different, there's nothing to combine, so it's already as simple as it can be!",
        "sectioneli5-0-13": "We have a math problem: 4x + 9x + 15 - 8. To make it simpler, we combine the numbers with x. So, 4x plus 9x becomes 13x. Then, we do the same with the plain numbers: 15 minus 8 gives us 7. So, our new simpler expression is 13x + 7.",
        "sectioneli5-0-14": "Simplifying means to make something easier. When you have something like '13 + b - 5', you can make it simpler by doing the math with the numbers. So, 13 minus 5 is 8. Now you just have '8 + b'. That's simpler!",
        "sectioneli5-0-15": "Imagine you have some apples, and you have 12 of them. Then you take away 5 apples and add 3 more apples. You want to know how many apples you have in total. In math, we call this process simplifying. When we simplify 12x - 5x + 3x, we're just putting all the 'x' apples together. So, if you have 12x and take away 5x, you have 7x left. Add 3x more, and you get 10x. So, 12x - 5x + 3x simplifies to 10x.",
        "sectioneli5-0-16": "To simplify 12x - (5x + 3x), first combine the x's in the brackets: 5x + 3x equals 8x. Then subtract 8x from 12x, which leaves you with 4x. So, 12x - (5x + 3x) simplifies to 4x.",
        "sectioneli5-0-17": "To make math problems shorter and easier, we simplify them by putting together similar parts. In the problem '20x - (x + x + x),' you add up the x's inside the brackets first, which gives '3x.' Then, 20x minus 3x equals 17x, and that's your simplified answer!",
        "sectioneli5-0-18": "When you see something like \\( \\frac{3}{8}x + \\frac{2}{8}x \\), think of it as cutting a pizza. If you have 3 out of 8 pieces of pizza plus 2 more out of 8, you simply add the slices together. So, 3 slices plus 2 slices make 5 slices out of 8. We do the same with the numbers in front of \\( x \\), so \\( \\frac{3}{8}x + \\frac{2}{8}x = \\frac{5}{8}x \\). It's kind of like saying, \"I have some of an \\( x \\) and more of an \\( x \\), let's put them together!\" Easy peasy!",
        "sectioneli5-0-19": "To simplify the expression \\(\\frac{3}{4}a + \\frac{2}{5}a\\), think of it like adding pieces of a pie. You have \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of a pie and \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the same pie, both labeled 'a'. To put them together, you need to make the pieces fit by finding the same size (common denominator). Then, you combine them to see how much of the pie 'a' you have in total.",
        "sectioneli5-0-20": "Imagine you have 3 pieces of a pie and your friend takes away 7 pieces, but you only have the numbers on paper. You're looking at how much you end up with: \\( \\frac{3}{10}g - \\frac{7}{10}g \\). Since you're taking away more than you have, you can put them together by subtracting: \\( 3 - 7 = -4 \\). So, you have \\(-\\frac{4}{10}g\\), which means you need to simplify to \\(-\\frac{2}{5}g\\). This shows how two fractions with the same 'pie' can be made smaller.",
        "sectioneli5-0-21": "To simplify expressions, we look at numbers and letters that are the same and add them. If you have '0.5c' and '3/5c,' they both have 'c,' so we can add the numbers together. Just like adding fractions or decimals, the result is the simplest form of what you started with. This is called simplifying.",
        "sectioneli5-0-22": "When you're asked to simplify something like '5p - 3.4p', think of it as combining things you already have. If you have 5 candies and you take away 3.4 candies, you will end up with 1.6 candies. In math speak, you’re left with '1.6p'. It's like cleaning up to make things neat and easy to understand.",
        "sectioneli5-0-23": "To simplify the expression 'r + 0.54r + 2r,' we need to add all the 'r' parts together. Think of 'r' like a toy block. If you have 1 block, 0.54 of a block, and 2 blocks, you stack them all up. Altogether, they make 3.54 blocks, or in this case, 3.54r. That's the simpler way to write it!",
        "sectioneli5-0-24": "When we have math problems like 'n - n + 6', we want to make them as simple as possible. Here, 'n' and '-n' cancel each other out because they’re the same thing, just opposite. So, what we’re left with is just '6'. That's what simplifying means!",
        "sectioneli5-0-25": "Here, you have two groups of things that look the same: \\(2\\frac{3}{4}x + 9\\). It's like having two piles of the same number of apples and oranges. If you put them together, just add the apples and oranges from both piles! So, \\((2\\frac{3}{4}x + 9) + (2\\frac{3}{4}x + 9)\\) becomes \\(2(2\\frac{3}{4}x) + 2 \\times 9\\). This gives you \\(2 \\times 2\\frac{3}{4}x + 18\\). Simplifying means just adding what's the same, and you get an easier number to work with: \\(5\\frac{1}{2}x + 18\\). This way, it’s simpler and tells you the same thing!",
