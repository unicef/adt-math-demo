If you have something that grows like a number to the power of N (for example, like 2 squared is 4), this rule tells you how it changes when you make tiny adjustments.\n\nThe rule tells us that if we know it works for one number (like 1), we can prove it also works for the next number by assuming it is true for that one and using similar reasoning. Thus, we can say it holds true for all numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.). In this way, we see that a special formula in mathematics works for any number if it starts working well and continues complying with the rule for the next number.",

Imagine you have a fraction with one function on top (f(x)) and another on the bottom (g(x)).\n2. The recipe says to: multiply the bottom part (g(x)) by the change of the top part (f'(x)), and then subtract the top part (f(x)) multiplied by the change of the bottom part (g'(x)).\n3. You divide all that by the square of what is at the bottom (g(x)).\n\nA trick to remember it is a rhyme: \"bottom times the change of top minus top times the change of bottom, all over the square of bottom.\" And that's how you find the derivative of the fraction!",
